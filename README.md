1.  Patient -- A customer/consumer of the healthcare service using the web site to determine something about their healthcare
2.  Healthcare Agent -- A support agent providing assistance with using the website via chat and video.
3.  Healthcare Doctor -- A Doctor who is available to provide immediate assistance through chat andvideo.

##Requirements

2.  Chrome or Firefox web browsers that support WebRTC.
3.  Eclipse with the latest beta of the WDT Tools installed.
4.  bower package manager

##Installation

1.  Clone the repository into a directory (i.e. $HOME/sample.rtcomm.healthcare)
```
git clone https://github.com/WASdev/sample.rtcomm.healthcare.git
```
2.  Install package dependecies:
``` 
cd $HOME/sample.rtcomm.healthcare/WebContent
bower install
```
3. Import the project into Eclipse 
4. Create a new liberty server(Presuming Liberty is already installed into the directory '$WLP')
```
$WLP/bin/server create ibmhealth
```
6.  Copy the serverxml/server.xml from the cloned project into the Liberty ibmhealth server directory.
```
cp $HOME/sample.rtcomm.healthcare/serverxml/server.xml $WLP/usr/servers/ibmhealth
```
7. Configure the MQTT Server and Topic Path:
  1.  Edit the `$WLP/usr/servers/ibmhealth/server.xml` file

    2.  Change the "\<RTCOMMTOPICPATH\>" to define the topic path for your system (Anything you want, but if you are using a **SHARED** MQTT Server then you need to make sure it is **UNIQUE**).
